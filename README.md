MY PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a software developer passionate about building large language models (LLMs) to study, analyze data, and draw meaningful connections. Here, you can find information about my projects, experiences, and how my work aims to make a positive impact, particularly in Kenya.

## Current Project: Missing Persons Database
https://github.com/Joymutheu-dev/MISSING-PERSONS-DATABASE-2024-KENYA-FINANCE-BILL-PROTESTS-

### Overview
The Missing Persons Database is an AI-powered platform designed to help track and identify individuals who have gone missing during the ongoing #RejectFinanceBill2024 protests in Kenya. The database allows users to add and search for information about missing persons, including names, ages, photos, last known locations, and contact details.

### AI Integration
AI plays a crucial role in this project by:
- Collecting and analyzing data from various sources such as social media, news reports, and eyewitness accounts.
- Identifying patterns and drawing connections between different cases to provide insights into potential locations or circumstances of missing persons.
- Facilitating communication and information sharing between families, law enforcement, and humanitarian organizations.

### Impact
This project aims to help families reunite with their loved ones and bring attention to the urgent issue of disappearances during protests. By leveraging AI, we hope to improve the efficiency and accuracy of tracking and finding missing persons.

## Previous Projects

### COVID-19 Tracking and Diagnosis (2020)
In 2020, I developed a deep learning model to track individuals with COVID-19 and to aid in diagnosing and screening for the virus in Kenya. This project involved:
- Using machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data and predict COVID-19 cases.
- Implementing a screening tool to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases early.

### Safe Kura - AI-Powered Blockchain Voting System (2024)
https://github.com/Joymutheu-dev/BLOCKCHAIN-VOTING-SYSTEM--SAFE-KURA
Safe Kura is a project I started in 2017, aiming to create a secure and transparent voting system using AI and blockchain technology. The goal was to ensure credible elections in Kenya by:
- Implementing a decentralized voting system resistant to tampering and fraud.
- Utilizing AI to analyze voting patterns and detect anomalies.

### Shillingi Yetu - Decentralized Kenyan Shilling (2024)
https://github.com/Joymutheu-dev/SHILLINGI-YETU--DECENTRALIZED-KENYAN-SHILLING-
Shillingi Yetu, launched in 2025, is a project focused on creating a decentralized Kenyan shilling to reduce poverty and enable financial inclusion. This initiative involved:
- Developing a blockchain-based currency to provide secure and accessible financial services.
- Empowering individuals and small businesses by facilitating easy and low-cost transactions.

## Career Impact and Contributions

These projects have been instrumental in shaping my career and expertise in data analysis and AI. They have provided me with a deeper understanding of how technology can be leveraged to solve real-world problems and make a significant impact on society. Through my work, I have gained valuable insights into data collection, analysis, and application, which I continue to apply to my ongoing projects.

Moreover, these initiatives have highlighted the potential of AI and blockchain technology to address pressing issues in Kenya, from healthcare to electoral integrity and financial inclusion. My goal is to continue developing innovative solutions that contribute to the betterment of my community and beyond.
